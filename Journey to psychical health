Journey to psychical health
1.	The first type of contact with feelings is the contact in privacy with yourself, this is an area of feelings, where are no external irritants. Make sure that you created at least a 1-week pause in your addiction and have not been affected by any chemical or unnatural stimulants. No drugs or porn are allowed because addiction suppresses all the feelings while we trying to establish contact with them. 
This kind of background feelings that always exists without any external irritants can be, for example, depression, when it's not clear where it came from. 
In this case, the tool of contact with feelings is reflexion. Don’t mix reflexion with overthinking or binge-reading of trashy psychological books, the process of true reflexion allows us to reveal and understand our feelings, estimate the scale of our feelings (compare the size of ourselves to the size of our feelings), and acknowledge all ugly, unpleasant and controversial facts behind our feelings with an awareness of consequences. It’s like a fair investigation based only on facts, you don’t need to take any other information to account. Just forget everything that others taught you, all brainwashing not based on facts, especially positive ones.
  
Do not be afraid to be disappointed in life, in your position in life, or other people. Feeling hides a fact even more unpleasant than feeling is. Ask yourself: "What do I feel or think of myself?", "Who I am in this situation?", "What is my position regarding this feeling or situation?  
 
Self-assertion with positive affirmations extends your suffering, but fair disappointment (based on facts) in people, relatives, in life will set you free.
 
- "How strong is your desire right now?" How disgusting is the reality without its satisfaction? If you feel fear - how big is it? 
Ask yourself: "How do I feel?" And then specify: "How badly?".  
 
-"I am angry." 
- "How badly?"
-"Very badly! So much that I am ready to tear and throw. So much that if I had a knife...," and so on. 
 
These are the questions that will allow us to speak out and verbalize information which will allow us to hear ourselves and accept unpleasant facts about our existence. Not just stories, but the very essence of the problem:
 
- "I feel loneliness."
- "How lonely am I?"
- "So much that there wouldn't be a single person in the world to comfort me. So much as if I was blind and would never see life around me..."
 
It is necessary to have a desire to get to the bottom of those feelings. Ask yourself about the consequences: 
"What if it's forever?" and "What do you think will happen in this case?".
 
- “Are you scared or anxious?” This is the stage when the question "What do I feel or think of myself?”, already has an answer - "Incomplete". The question now is: “how scared you are?”. “What scares you so much that you need to urgently do something to make life seem more significant?” If you're sure it's just entertainment that billions of people are busy with, then why does your life lose any meaning without it? How much more tasteless is everything than your instincts have predicted? How your fictional reality made up in dreams do not correspond to actual reality? How much do you expect something that does not come true year after year? 
There are no wrong answers. The more you realize the contrast, the more painful the facts about the reality you can survive, the easier it will be for you to live on. 
You already know that your self-esteem is at the bottom - it remains to know how deep this bottom is. Moreover, it's not even about your self-esteem, but about the reality and that's the point. We constantly hide the real facts from ourselves, trying to cover them up with our achievements. We hide not only certain failures but also the feeling that we are still insignificant. It's very difficult to deceive ourselves, get rid of this feeling, we have to make an incredible effort to convince ourselves that we're okay and we're doing a great job. 
 
Remember what you felt when you were rejected from the source of pleasure or punished, fired, insulted, humiliated:
- "What do I feel or think of myself in this traumatic situation?” 
- “Helpless, meaningless, useless.”
 
We are not afraid of helplessness - we cannot change many things and still sleep peacefully. The helplessness in itself is not a problem - we need to identify the act of depreciation of ourselves and ask the appropriate questions: "How insignificant are you in this situation?", "What consequences can this have?", "What if you will always be like this? 
Awareness of the scale of your insignificance will release a huge amount of tension, as well as solve an existing problem, whatever it may be. At a minimum, it is always useful to use it as part of the therapy. 
 
Please, note: true reflexion process lies in revealing and understanding of feelings, estimating the scale of the feelings (comparison of the size of ourselves to the size of these feelings), and acknowledgment of all ugly, unpleasant, and controversial facts behind them with their consequences. 
If you do only some part of this process – your progress will be extended for years, while true reflexion works almost immediately. 
You need to write down whole the reflexion process in this specific order and then read it aloud, verbalizing it. This is how reflexion works. 
The first time, after reading about this method I was too lazy to actually practice it and therefore first try failed without even proper beginning of it. But after 2 years of struggle with my mental health, I found time to do everything properly again, and I have read that huge russian book about this method again and found many mistakes that I did even I was warned about them in the book. 
So, on the second try, I got immediate results – all of my headaches and heaviness in my head was gone in a couple of minutes. The next morning, I woke up with such a light head that I even thought that I did not have it. But I could hear, think, and feel. It was a feeling of rebirth, but no supernatural forces or religion were mixed to it. So now I can confirm: you can be healthy and happy without any religion, drugs, or any other supernatural external influences. 
True reflexion can fix most of the problems (except healing terminally ill patients or pathological liars). This method needs to be followed meticulously in a fair manner without embellishing whatever it is and without protecting reality (or the people we care or cared about) from unpleasant facts under the whole process of reflexion. Only plain facts matter and verbalization of them in private space by yourself. 
Even if some fact feels like illegal – you should legalize your dissatisfaction with this unpleasant fact in your head.
Also, try not to make up some positive sweet facts about your position in life or about your relatives, school, government. Sweet positive facts can’t be the reason behind your miserable feelings. You need to utilize all your energy to blame the world and other people as much as it’s possible, but all this information needs to be verbalized in private. Nobody deserves to hear your blaming, hatred, and aggression personally against them. In the reflexion process, we deal with facts, not with real people.
- “How could we feel safe alone with ourselves?” 
- ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
- “Did we have a chance not to get all the traumas we suffered?” 
- ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
- “Could we have been more relaxed in this situation?” 
- ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..…
- “If there was nothing left in the world but this moment, how empty would life be?”
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
 
If you think that the answer to this question will relate to a hypothetical situation - you are wrong. 
This is exactly how empty life is right now. 
This is one of the main laws - you can't feel what doesn't exist in your psyche. 
 
- “How much do you need something relevant to you right now? “
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- “How insignificant are you to the object, which drugs your attention?”
- ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… 
Do not try to devalue your desires when you are faced with the scale that your consciousness draws you. 
- “How much are you dependent on?”
- ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… 
- “What consequences do you expect if you admit it?”
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- “Is loneliness one of them?” 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- “Do you expect the world to try to reject you for the mere thought of being dependent?” 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
                                                                       
(That's how disgusting it is)
- “And what if that addiction never goes away?”
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
 
Look, there are so many addictions. Research all of them in your reflexion process and try to accept their inevitability. Notice that you have the least desire to be addicted and you would give a lot not to feel it. 
 
Notice your resistance. The fact of addiction is even more disgusting and scarier than the feelings because the feeling can be avoided, hidden from it, satisfied for a while. 
It is like a mark burned on your forehead so that everyone would walk and laugh at you: "Just look at him! He is addicted!" as if no one has ever experienced anything like this, unlike you. 
As if it were the most terrible sin you could commit - to feel the need. Stupid, isn't it? 
But we perceive it in that way and it would be fairer to not deny it. 
 
Look closely: 
- "If you were the biggest sinner on the planet, would the walls of your room fall on you?" 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- “Is your life collapsing right now when you feel it all? Will it crumble later?”
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- “Are you ready for reality not to be what you would like it to be?”
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- “If you find proof that you are the worst person in the universe, will the walls of your room move closer to you?”
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- “Does reality want to punish you for your thoughts and feelings?
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- “Maybe reality just doesn't give a shit about you, and you are much more afraid to see that than to expect punishment?”
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
 
When I was asked: "What are you like?", I could answer that I am disgusting even physically. 
"How disgusting?" - So much that I feel leper and cursed as if pus was flowing from me, and nobody would ever touch me or talk to me. 
"What are the consequences of admitting this fact to the public? - The answers varied, depending on the period in my life and the layer of my consciousness in which I was located at this time. 
It was always the expectation of loneliness, but the difference was in what format it was. If everything started with an abstract fear of becoming an outcast, then at some point, it was not just an outcast, but also the fact that people will laugh at me in the process. At another moment it was an expectation that I would be so ugly that people would be forbidden to talk to me, even if someone wanted to. I saw the consequences of disgusting loneliness, hardly comparable with anything else. In the end, this feeling has naturally turned into the external world.
 
 As it happens, if not the reality is disgusting, then it is necessarily us.
 If blame is not on reality, then it is necessarily on us, and so on. 
If a person has a problem with often underestimated self-esteem, most likely, he simply can't afford to speak out about the world around him, which deserves to be devalued. And if you read carefully, reality does have things that deserve our displeasure. And as long as a person thinks that he needs to love his life, to be grateful to it, to expect the best, nothing is surprising that he is not satisfied with himself.
And these are the most connected things - exactly as much a person tries to love life, exactly on the same scale he hates himself. 
Just one expression of dissatisfaction will allow you to feel all the nuances of a disgusting life. Because it's one thing to read and think, and another thing to spend hours of your time on it, verbalizing unpleasant feelings and facts out loud. And the dissatisfaction alone will make your life much easier psychologically if it is legalized. 
 
It is the legality of dissatisfaction that plays a key role because usually, we can be as dissatisfied as we want, but we are not to telling anyone about it or trying to suppress the scale of discontent. Most often, the scale is unknown to us if there is no one to who we can listen to us without any interception or censorship. 
We often can’t even say everything to ourselves without our censorship. 
In short: be dissatisfied, verbalize your disgust if you find it, and you will be fine. Of course, with an awareness of the scale, this method works much faster, but you can also begin to practice without it.
 
Please, note: If you try using this method and didn’t get any result – try reread this book after some pause. Sometimes the scale of lies which we bear in ourselves just blocks the way to fair practice of this method. So, you can try to give you time to dissolve the lies brainwashed into you by the unpleasant truth of this book. Remember, unpleasant facts are not that bad when you are fully aware of them and don’t suppress your feelings. This book intends to help you. It was not this book that threw you into misery or depression, but this book will help you to get free from endless slavery induced by thousands of years of brainwashing.
 
Trauma is a three-layered ball: facts produce feelings and ignored feelings come out as symptoms.
The further we are from the fact, the stronger the symptoms are. 
When people try to get out of the trauma by willpower, positive affirmations, and spiritual teachings, they are dangerously close to the possibility of worsening their condition. And this becomes exactly the reason why the problems and feelings get stuck in us for the rest of our lives.
 
For some reason, we are wildly convinced that we must somehow confront the facts, moving away from them, bewildering ourselves, but not allowing us to change the perception of life. 
That's why the typical acceptance (when you forgive the object of this acceptance) does not work - the fact must always remain a fact in its inviolable inevitability, and we must never try to forget the damage. Even on the contrary, we should try to understand it in every possible way:
- "What will you be like if you give up these pleasures?"; 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
The approximate answers you need: empty, meaningless, bad, dissatisfied.
- "How much of this feeling is in you?" 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "What will happen if this feeling remains in you forever?"
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "What fact do you think you're trying to hide from yourself by infinitely filling the emptiness inside you?  
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
 
The problem with depression is that all feelings are replaced by emptiness. To some extent, you can even say that it's a fairly light emptiness, barely tangible. It is so light that the thoughts to kill yourself easily come to mind. Simply because life is so empty that there is no reason to stay in it. Everything loses its weight, simply because the pleasures begin to be absent, as a phenomenon. 
 
"Is it worth to continue living in this meaningless reality, if it does not even bring pleasure?" - one of the most common thoughts. 
 
The fact is that life has always been meaningless, but this fact is visible only if you lose the ability to get pleasure. People kill themselves not because life loses its meaning, but because they lose the ability to feel. 
 
 
The depression went away as soon as I assumed that it’s the feeling of emptiness that flooded me and I could just let it go through myself. And I did what I wanted least, which I fought against for months. I went to bed and asked myself: 
- "How much is there emptiness in me?" (It took me 15 minutes to answer it) 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "What is this emptiness?"
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "What would you compare it with? 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
(Try to describe your metaphor in as much detail as possible)
- "How much of it remains inaccessible to the consciousness just because you are running away from it?"
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "Assuming that you are running away in terror from a feeling, what consequences do you unknowingly expect if this feeling catches up with you?"
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "Assuming that you are haunted by a disgusting fact, which it can be?”
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "What do you think that you could be dissatisfied with?"
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "How much of this dissatisfaction is in you?"
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "Do you think that you should suppress it?”
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
The next stage is connected with the remaining feeling of helplessness, senselessness, and uselessness. We will need to use all the available discontent because only through this discontent you can understand the necessary facts. If we cannot be dissatisfied with life, we are always dissatisfied with ourselves, and this discontent makes us helpless. 
We have a lot of it, and life has sinned billions of times against us. We are wildly dissatisfied with it, but when we cannot give our blame to it, we direct our natural aggression into ourselves, crushing ourselves even stronger than any disease. 
You are not aware of the consequences of someone's actions or events. You are always used to take responsibility for your pain. 
 
- "Who is in charge of the fact that you are broken? What did they do for it?" 
- ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… 
- "Were you born this way or were you made this way by your parents?” 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "How much life and people around you have broken you?"
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "How exactly?"
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- " What do I feel or think about reality now?” 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
 
I don't leave hospitals all my life, I vomit after eating, I have no sense of life, no resources to live it. It's as if I was born to be broken. What kind of monsters are my parents? Is it fair? By no means! I am the most broken man on the planet. At least in the family. 
 
It is always possible to return to questions and add new information to the scale. Nobody has ever seriously accused anybody or anything about what happened to him. Because if people could give up all aggression accepted from outside (positive brainwashing too) - all symptoms would disappear, including the depression-maniac swings. But you are likely ready to do what is absolutely unnatural and even inadequate in your situation. And when that oppression occurs, quite a large part of oppression can be simply a mechanism to restrain you from excessive violence against yourself. 
The scale of the facts is inexpressible. This is not just destruction - this is the absence of your scenario of life from birth.  We have one major problem - the lack of rights to live. And there is no other more effective way to realize this right than to realize the tragedy of the damage.
Please, note: nobody deserves to hear your blaming, hatred, and aggression personally against them. In the reflexion process, we deal with facts, not with real people.
 
By removing the halo of sanctity, by legalizing the brokenness of the surrounding world in all its dimensions, we will rid ourselves of the feeling that it’s only we who are broken. 
 
- "Are other people broken too? If so, how badly?"
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "Who needs such broken people?”
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "How much have you been broken by life? (your parents, anything else)" 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
 
Legalize your discontent, rewire your aggression from yourself to the world around. Write it down, speak out loudly.
 
You have every right to be yourself because no one else will give you that right. This life deserves nothing except you exactly in the way as you can be, and not what others want you to be. The people around you are generally brainless pigs who expect the same from everyone as they expect from themselves. Only expression of the most open hatred and disgust can cure you. Open, of course, not in terms of the intensity of expression on people, but in terms of legalizing it in itself, in your body. The more legalized you have such feelings, the less intense they are, but first, of course, you must expect an explosion of such experiences. 
 
It is important to understand that all your life you considered everyone around you right, you have raised them almost to the rank of saints, even if they annoyed you. And this is perhaps the most important task - to remove the halo of holiness, omniscience, and omnipotence from the surrounding people. All neurological symptoms such as stress, panic attacks, derealization, anxiety, and others will disappear on their own. A proper answer to the question: "Are people holy?" may take several hours, but it will be worth it. 
 
As with all other traumas, the question is not what are you feeling, but how many feelings and facts are you trying to hide from yourself. And do not forget that all of those symptoms can pass, if you just legalize your discontent and find the skill to verbalize your feelings.
 
People are filled with diseases as if it was their meaning of life, and often they do not want to let them go or even recognize them. But even such terrible diseases can be cured with the help of psychology if you are not afraid of the facts and feelings that follow them. The individual symptom itself is removed quite simply. You need to track at what points it is most active and what kind of feeling it is like. To do this we ask the questions: 
- "If we assume that this is a feeling, what feeling would it be?" 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "What emotional reaction does this symptom cause?
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
 
 When the feeling is revealed, we should feel it and verbalize it aloud. You can start by recording all your feelings, and then you can easily verbalize them even without recording when there is more internal space for reflexion. Openness is everything. Most often, your nervous system is not working properly because of suppressed aggression, although there can be other feelings too. Other symptoms can be associated with neglected feelings: migraines, phantom pains in obscure areas, heart pain, and tachycardia. Interestingly, all that is associated with pain in this case is often a sign of an attempt to ignore (suppress) aggression. Psychosomatics can also give a sense of a certain restraint. You can recognize it as some internal censor who talks about how good and how bad that particular feeling is. You can make psychosomatic symptoms almost impossible to appear if you first realize the scale of this pressure, through questions like: 
- "How much do you suppress in yourself the 'wrong' feelings? 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- “How much harm and pain has this suppression caused you?"
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "What would you expect if you let all your feelings be present in your body without fear of psychological genocide? 
This will lead us to a fact that sounds something like this: 
-       "If you allow absolutely any feeling to invade the body without hindrance, it threatens with madness or total loneliness, but it is the only way to go through it".
 
 And if it is understood, at least most of the symptoms will never happen again, and it will be much easier for the person to get along with his own experiences.
 
The attempt to be holy and to sacrifice yourself as the main meaning of life will not allow you to be happy. How can a person be happy if such a sacrifice takes away his own life? We can try and hope that person has enough intelligence to realize that his whole essence raised from childhood in him is that what destroys him to the core. But, unfortunately, anxiety takes all intelligence to its service. Anxiety is directly related to unnatural goodness! The greatest effect here will be to remove the halo of sanctity from the authoritative figures, who have created in man unshakable moral foundations that destroy him from the inside.
- “Who influenced your view of the world?”
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- “How do your parents feel about your failures?” 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- “How well do they treat you in general?”
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
  
Ask yourself about things that cause irritation and aggression - whether there are such things and what do you do with this irritation. 
The accumulated aggression will provide an opportunity to answer questions: 
 
- "What do I feel or think of myself?", "Who I am in this situation?", 
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
- "What is my position regarding this feeling or situation?”  
- …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
Describe the scale of the feeling accordingly to you
 
Become aware of all your discontent and verbalize it aloud, realizing everything you need. But if you only quickly jump from a feeling of helplessness to aggression, and from aggression to hysterics, you can ignore the disgusting world around you for a very long time, it will extend your suffering. And if at first, this anger will be just anger, then, later, it will be realized as an unbearable feeling of helplessness, which must be urgently compensated by the aggression that you will suppress. And then comes the feeling of disgust of life, in which there are so many things that cause both helplessness and aggression. With the help of irritability, you hide from yourself much more unattractive facts of this life, so that unspoken anger is just a good way to realize the scale of surrounding shit. 
Even the first attempts at awareness and such total honesty with yourself will give incredible results. If we honestly see that the world is disgusting - there is no point in pretending to be good yourselves. And that will remove a lot of tension.
 
Well, that's all, thanks to the reflexion process the symptom has gone. Now you can follow a course of disgust while realizing your imperfection. Nowadays we hear a very populist phrase "Don't be indifferent", but there are certain levels in our psyche where the only way to be healthy is to be indifferent. And now this lack of indifference is destroying millions of people, creating hundreds of symptoms, co-dependent relationships, food disorders, and so on. Because the prohibition of indifference forces us to pretend to be good people, to please others, ignoring what is natural, but what others will not like in us (99% of our psyche). And the only way to be healthy in a world where everything is absorbed by the positive brainwashing is to be as indifferent as possible. Indifference is not the same as a blockade to facts, it’s more like a non-judgemental way to observe them without overreacting.
This in no way means that you will stop helping other people, but you will be pragmatic rather than emotional, which will keep your nervous system intact.
 
Please, note: you will feel even worse right after the start of the reflexion process, but after a short time you will feel much greater than before. 
 
 
1.1 Spotting and dealing with co-dependency.
The inability to endure the disgusting reality provokes hunger - the desire to compensate for this disgusting reality. And when there is a person who will tell us how good we are and how he understands us, it causes incredible satisfaction, we lose our strength to separate from these people. Co-dependent people don't have any part of themselves in them, and it means that they will take someone else's life to fill their own. They will grow into their savior because he will provide meaning to their meaningless life. They have no idea about the value of their own life, the value of their views, and in general the value of everything connected with them. That is what makes it so easy for such people to understand the others and to fully reconstruct their world view. When there is no value, no resistance, or critical thinking - everything is taken on faith. Such "trust" will bribe anyone, especially if you are a teenager whose inferiority complex is raging with all its might. You won't even notice how you've been swallowed - addicts, without knowing it. There are only two ways to understand that something is going wrong, but they are often ignored. The first is when you start asking questions on your subject, meeting a complete lack of understanding at the level of context and meaning of what was said. The co-dependent addict will fake cognitive activities more easily than managers who imitate their work. 
And the second way is when you start trying to help the person in need in a way that will make him/her feel uncomfortable.  
 
Symptoms of co-dependency: Porridge in the head, inability to go through the reflexion process, inability to make creative decisions, loss of contact with yourself, loss of creative impulses, the disappearance of the ability to have fun. The loss of contact with oneself leads to the impossibility to enjoy life because our pleasure is a derivative of the connection with internal, not external things like movies and other benefits of civilization. Pleasure gives us the right to be, however small it may be. In a co-dependent relationship, it disappears almost completely or completely - it depends on how much guilt have you managed to take on you. No more of your desires, you sink into oblivion forever and will never know if these are your desires or not. The addicted person does not know himself. The inability to have fun is followed by a depressive state in which life loses all meaning. You do not have yourself, there is no pleasure, there are no thoughts, there are no goals, all your life rests on one person, and without him or her you cannot do anything, you cannot move anywhere. 
 
Absorption leads to the disappearance, and when you disappear, the value of your life also disappears, leading to suicidal or self-destructive impulses. It is very difficult (and embarrassing) to talk about such relationships (and the problems in them) to other people. The victims experience different feelings - guilt, shame, or fear. They feel fear that they will find out how much they were wrong in choosing a partner and how much they invested in him. These are just extreme sacrifices that are very painful to think about. The co-dependent person will have to go through the awareness of what makes him be that person under the reflexion process, and it will be quite a difficult experiences but most of them pass in a few days. As always, we expect special physical symptoms, confirming that the trauma bubble has burst and flooded the nervous system and is digested now. That means, the person can be nauseous, he can be very sick, his head or heart will hurt wildly. Those symptoms will appear, and then they will pass in a few days. If it lasts longer than a week, then another intervention is needed - most likely, the motivation to change was another self-deception or misunderstanding that occurred.
 
In general, any trauma burst quickly enough if you know that you need to understand its scale rather than trying to escape from it as soon as possible. In the case of co-dependant addicts, they will have to face an internal psychopath, which we all have inside us, where there are constructions of indifference and disregard, which we have been trying to suppress since childhood. It just so happens that co-dependant addicts are so scared of this indifference that they overreacted, causing to themselves a huge fear of life. As we already know, the more people pretend to be good, the more they are afraid of the world around them. These co-dependent addicts are also afraid to live independently, because they perceive life as such a psychopath, although it's just a projection of their inner mental object to the external world. All of us inside are quite indifferent and self-sufficient, and we all try to cope with this in so many ways because it is very uncultured to be indifferent nowadays. And co-dependence is the most extreme degree of trying to hide this indifference. They say, look, I am a dog on a leash, here is my cage, I am already going there.
 Of course, all of this works unconsciously, and no one has ever guessed about it on their own. It just happens and that's all. 
Signs of co-dependency: 
1.	The person on the outside is depressed, his eyes are begging for help and support. Such a person looks to be taken care of, so this is the first sign of a co-dependent addict. This is exactly what will be the starting point in the world of guilt and fear of abandonment. 
2.	Because of the victim's state of mind, this person most often does not have friends to share his life and his problems with. He will cling to the other half as the solution to all his problems. The cycle of "victim-rescuer-rapist" will be started. If you try to get out, you will be a “rapist” who feels guilty, because you will leave the poor person all alone. 
3.	It often happens that such a person just does not want to do anything. He has only porridge in his head, so he also has no strength for anything. His favorite place is the horizontal position with access to the Internet.
 
 
1.	Convertation.
The second area of contact with feelings is:
1.	contact with an internal mental object that seems to us to be something separate from us. It can be some internal voice that can say something to us on behalf of our parents, our friends. This voice devalues, humiliates, disapproves, condemns, rejects, intimidates and so on;
2.	actual interacting with some real person or group of people, 
 
Convertation is a change of direction of our interaction with the inner voice or other people. Convertation is the realization of our desire to live and be happy, contrary to all brainwashing and parental oppression. You can do anything except suppressing yourself and abusing yourself. 
 
The main essence of convertation: fear, guilt, and shame does not exist. There is just a certain excitement of the nervous system. which is designed to improve your life, to draw some conclusions, to make some calculations, to realize a fact, to change the situation or do something. 
In many people, this system does not work because all parenting is built on limiting our energy. And how is it limited? - Judging, shaming, blaming, resenting, and so on. Therefore, we develop similar reactions – our real parents become internalized as mental objects that seem to be separate from us and restrictions continue to work even when our real parents are dead or located hundreds of miles away from us. “Who is a good boy?” - The one who restricts himself – thus is the whole essence of all interaction with parents. If you want parents to like you – you should be like your parents.
 
You have the opportunity to take certain steps to get rid of this judging voice. Now you need to make a list of things that you would like to do, but that you are afraid to do, things that would make you happy, maybe even small things that you were forbidden to do by this voice that scares you.
 
That voice says you will either get nothing or you will be condemned, rejected, embarrassed, or even die. When you have a list and you realize what you can't allow yourself to do, whether to laugh loudly or even cry… when you see the whole picture how beautiful, relaxed, funny, touching, vulnerable your connection with people could be, but this voice won't let you do it.
 
When you see it, you can take the next step, which is to start trying to do these things, and you might notice that these things give you some insight into what you don't want to be in front of other people, what you don't think people will accept in you.
 
Fear is some kind of energy within us, it's our readiness for something, our virility, some kind of natural aggression, some manifestation of ourselves, our strength, our readiness for problems, for loneliness, for power, to take care of ourselves. When you find fear - do not try to avoid it, and do not think about the fact that there are any pathways around it. The main task is to be aware of the fear, to decide in what direction you need to convert it. For example, if you are a guy and you want to talk to a girl - you certainly have the fear to do it. Let's deal with this fear, first of all, it is fear that you suddenly will find yourself being helpless. It arises because we have a certain belief that when we go near to a girl, for some reason we would be unable to take care of ourselves if we start to be rejected or aggressively destroyed. We expect some kind of rejection, which will potentially devalue us and for some reason - the possibility to take care of ourselves will be turned off as if we don't even have the right to feel indifferent about the fact that we've been rejected. This is a very strange feeling, which is very related to upbringing because the child had no right to defend himself. The child couldn't give back to his father or mother at least to a certain age. We got used to the fact that when we received the punishment - we had no right to disagree with it because any disagreement with the punishment gave us even more punishment, fighting for ourselves could simply destroy us when we were children. This is ingrained in our hearts, but now we are not children anymore, and the girl is not a parent who can physically punish us. We do have the opportunity to protect ourselves, to feel aggression and willingness at least not to be hurt. But there are consequences - and this is the second cause of fear: If we are ready to defend ourselves - we start to see that person who can potentially have some impact on us. If we see that person, if we come into contact with that person, then we find out that we see imperfection in them, and even if we're ready for it - suddenly we start to recognize a certain non-ideal image of the person and even small minuses that we wouldn't even see initially. This happens because we are ready to allow ourselves to be dissatisfied with people, even those who try to judge us. We took our value from others and returned to ourselves and then other people lost their ideality for us.
 
We can say that the value is something like water and it is quite limited. It can be either in a world where the world is awesome, people are powerful as gods and we are flawed hobos who can hardly cope with their lives or with their looks and so on. Or this certain amount of power, perfection, beauty, the value can flow from other people to us and then people lose their ideality for us. The question is “Can we afford to feel this inner value inside ourselves?”. And when it happens mostly unconsciously, absolutely accidentally, when a person never wanted it at all - we call it a disappointment. And people struggle very hard to feel it, just because they never wanted to experience it. 
 
The main purpose of all people is to preserve the best possible memory, the best possible attitude to other people and life. We were all brought up in this way, it was relevant to our parents. And quite another thing when disappointment happens, when we are ready for dissatisfaction, for any act of our natural aggression. Then there is nothing so painful about it, maybe it will be some small period, maybe a couple of days, maybe about an hour - when you find that people are not so important, even those people who seemed to be important once ago. Now they have lost their value. It doesn't generally take much time and it always goes almost painlessly and life does not collapse from it, doesn't become more pessimistic. Although you will be a great realist, you will be able to predict different things, your mental condition will be quite easy. And I wouldn't suggest you doing that if it would only make your life harder in the end. Yes, it can be very painful, but you know, it will end. And when the disappointment process is over and has the right effect - it will be easy for you, you will really relax, you will not suppress anything, and most importantly - you will not suppress yourself in a relationship with anyone.
 
If we are aware of the facts, if we allow certain feelings to happen, if we allow ourselves to actualize certain feelings, such as our natural aggression, our life will be better. Yes, it will be unpleasant at some point, but you are now dying in pleasant discomfort, in a pleasant sense of security, which brings anxiety, oppression, and boredom. Some secret code to get out of this situation does not exist, you cannot just bypass your feelings to be prepared for potentially dangerous situations. We have to conclude by ourselves, and in this way we become more reasonable, this way we get clarity in our lives.
 
A person who wants to be a saint needs to limit himself - this is our main ambition and it also makes us afraid, simply because we have a lot of needs and a lot of questions to the current government, our parents, and our relationship partner, our business partner… there are a huge number of questions that we do not ask and which turns into a fake feeling of guilt, shame, and fear within us. There is some energy in our nervous system and in a normal state of health it would really be some kind of excitement, but since we were taught to limit ourselves, any excitement of this energy strikes back on ourselves. 
This means that if you feel guilty - someone else is guilty of it if you feel shame - it means with a hundred percent probability that someone deserves to be judged if you are in this fear - it means that someone deserves your rage. But you have been taught not to use your energy, so this unused energy turns into fear, guilt, and shame. Yes, someone deserves our rage, but we can't afford to express this level of rage, we are all used to tolerate it. Note: no kind of hopelessness can destroy a person who is 100% sure that he or she is not guilty of it.
 
It is very important to understand what kind of aggression I talk about because if you are already irritated with something and you are not afraid of it and your aggression, your dissatisfaction, your disagreement with something or your pain is constant, cyclical, It comes back again and again - most likely it has nothing to do with the constructive aggression that designed to help you. 
 
Aggression that we are not afraid to show, that does not originate in fear - is useless. Aggression that we need can scare even more than the fear that is already present. This is an aggression that does not start from conflict but creates it. We are always afraid to be in conflicts, and we don't want to start them. For example, if you feel guilty in co-dependent relationships, then to show constructive aggression means - to start a conflict, to create it with your own hands, which most likely will lead to a certain argument or some emotional outrage. No one deserves our rage unless we are talking about a certain physical threat. Our certain dissatisfaction with people is generally only our problem. And if you are dissatisfied with something and for some reason you have stayed with this person - the aggression is usually aimed at enabling you to get away from this person, rather than trying to tolerate her or him and surely to not try to change that person. 
 
When the convertation happened - it means that there was guilt and you blamed yourself for something and you suddenly realize, you start at least just to assume that the person you feel guilty of - he is guilty of something, and you need to find an equivalent of your feeling of guilt in this person. Essentially, convertation is a change of direction of one of these three feelings (fear, guilt, and shame). 
For example, when a girl feels guilty for not being doing well on the school and she feels this guilt in front of her parents (by the way, she can feel guilty in front of her inner voice, which she can't distinguish from the voice of her parents) - she does it to not realize the fact that if her parents would physically punish her for it, then they are really bad parents.
 
You will find that you have never been the real recipient of these feelings. No guilt, no shame, no fear... you have never deserved them. All you have to do is to turn them back: if you feel guilt - there is someone who deserves to be blamed. When you're afraid - someone else has to be afraid of you.
 
We all are so used to love all kinds of shit and we were brought up to be helpless in life, helpless in relationships with our parents, even if our parents hadn't any intentional goal to bring up a helpless person. But unfortunately, it already happened, so the mechanism is already running and it can't be stopped. All we can do is just to rewire the control. To reassign directions, assuming that someone else deserves to be blamed. Be not afraid to find this accusation, this condemnation, realize the scale of this accusation, and implement it in relationship with other person in form of constructive aggression - like making some conclusions or taking care of yourself, protecting yourself under physical threat. The main thing is not to leave any oppressed state inside yourself and find the recipient, or at least if the recipient is not found, to allow yourself to feel a counter-accusation. If you feel guilty, but do not know the exact reason, just let yourself be dissatisfied, be some kind of aggressive, not necessarily angry. 
Constructive aggression is not only anger, it can be anger and rage to a certain extent, but it can be also indifference, dissatisfaction, and disagreement, intolerability, a sense of injustice, even the process of fulfillment of your inner desires. Anything that is not self-blaming, self-limitation can be considered as constructive aggression. And we need to learn how to be constructively aggressive.
 
Constructive aggression is to draw conclusions and leave your co-dependent partner, not just to start conflict once and forget about it. Of course, it is possible to discuss the problems in a relationship verbally, if there is some possibility to fix something. But basically, we use convertation to deal with something huge, far away from situational problems, that could be easily corrected. In co-dependency, we deal with the problems which it would be better not to allow it at all. 
To deal with the physical threat, you need to do something to match this threat with the same scale of aggression. It means that you need to use aggression on the same scale as that person which trying to attack you. And if it's a dog, if you need to stop being afraid of it and make yourself ready to defend yourself. You need to find in yourself the same animal aggression equivalent to the aggression of this dog.
 
The feeling of uncertainty is our friend, one of our main allies. Because it means that we are now angry or disagreeing with something or realize our desire, constructively. Not just out of irritation or something else, but really because we need it. And this is what will cure us, what will make us calmer. Peace finds not in the realm of peace, it is always at the bottom of horror. And you don't have to be afraid to sink there. Because as soon as you realize that you have aggression, and all this energy of fear, shame, and guilt is our inner virility, natural energy of ourselves, then there will be nothing scary in those feelings. But to do this you will have to immerse yourself in the already existing horror and definitely not in peace. 
 
Do your best to not avoid fear. We don't need the right to be ourselves, because what issues us this right is what terrorizes us. We need to give up all providers of this special right and find ourselves in a society where we have all the necessary rights written on paper and that's enough. Legal laws have no instructions about how to fear, hate yourself, destroy yourself. There is just a certain set of laws and rules, and there is nothing about your emotional states and you can easily obey these laws, without any emotional stress. 
So please feel the power to be free from all kinds of brainwashing slavery and religious oppression. No sects, no gods have the power to make us suffer if we are not giving them this right.
 
All the most important things are in a state of weakness when you can realize that you are vulnerable. That you are vulnerable even to yourself, you can realize your real status and what is going on around you. You have all the chances to be disappointed and you don't have to be afraid of it. Although it will always be scary, you don't have to resist it, because only at the bottom of this uncertainty, terror and disappointment is the energy to cope with it. 
 
To not persecute yourself - you need to convert these feelings of guilt, shame, and fear. You need to redirect your inner energy, melt it into constructive aggression. Letting yourself to live and be happy, even if you make mistakes, is quite a huge act of constructive aggression. When you make a mistake, you can say: "It's okay, I can fix this". And if you actually can’t fix something, say: "What could I do? I can just try not to make these mistakes again". 
By using these methods of reflexion and convertation you will not become some sort of psychopath who spits down on everyone and have an attitude like: "well, I can go to kill people, it's okay. Using constructive aggression is the way just to feel good, even if you made a mistake somewhere. It doesn't make you a murderer, it just allows your inner biological energy to flow through you, to feel this life and want to live it. 
 
It is possible to convert even a small level of fear, shame, and guilt into constructive aggression. But when this is happening it goes in a non-violent way. If your main purpose is to avoid unpleasant feelings – you will just abuse yourself even with these methods. 
I will write more about how to spot our inner monster, our inner abuser, and how to recognize his tricks on the early stages. This little monster like chameleon constantly changes his appearance. He can use any method to abuse people even more. That’s why religious sects are so dangerous because positive intentions were turned to abuse and destruction. 
 
Please, note: even if you are doing the right things, even if you follow instructions from this book and you feel some distinct muscular tension, some distinct inflammation of your mind – be aware, it can be the signs of an inner abuser. This little monster can intercept every process in our minds. So, it’s better to rest more, exercise more, and do some simple job to get rid of him for some time in a natural non-violent way. 
This mental object is so smart that it can steal all our energy while we are struggling to fight it. But the good news is that it can’t do much harm to us if we can learn how to recognize his tricks. The easy-peasy book is so powerful because it’s aware of this inner monster existence and it gives advice on how to recognize it. That will be the main theme of the 3rd chapter.
 
 
Find yourself deprived, in vulnerability.
Find yourself who has lost his inner God.
Rediscover yourself, from the very beginning.
Start from the bottom of the human ocean.
Everything starts from the roots, do not chase the flowers.
Wipe away the borders, remove the defenses - they don’t really protect you.
Remember that life is just another dream between the others.
Know that You are your own light at the end of your own tunnel. 
 
There is neither the first nor the last. They will command you: "Succeed!", but they want to break your nervous system. And if your life is a distance from a point A to a point B, then you are the line, the most primitive part of the geometrical figures. And if you want to mean something more to people, just let them go and love yourself like a blossoming lily.
 
I'll tell you in secret: life is a dance, not a sphere of activity. 
If you have lost your value, do not look for it in another profession.
It is better to learn the dance, that children are dancing.
